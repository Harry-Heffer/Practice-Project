                <p id="main-text">This webpage is a place for pacticing web development. I am developing a forum to practice front-end and back-end development, this can be accessed from the Navigation bar at the top left of this webpage by clicking on Forum. My aim is to also make this website have a responsive design so that it can be viewed on devices with different screen sizes.<br /><br />Here on the Homepage I will list projects I have developed in the sidebar, the idea at the moment is to manipulate the DOM (Document Oject Model) to change the content on this page without taking the user to a new webpage. I will also be using the space to the right as a place to showcase the projects I have developed and allow these to be interacted with by a user visiting the page.<br /><br />Please explore this website to see what I have been working on.</p>
